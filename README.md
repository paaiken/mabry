Hello Wonderful People!

I am currently writing a paper to be published that is due Feb. 5th, so I will
unfortunately be very busy until then. However, I wanted to stop in and share 
some of my thoughts for how I thought this project would go. Feel free to edit
the README.md and changed anything. We could also do a skype or a phone call to 
plan some of this out. 

However, I was thinking that the best thing to do is to use Google Cloud 
Platform as the base for our machine learning algorithm. The beauty of it is 
that google machine learning database is constantly learning as the world 
continues to use it. Plus, it makes to where we are not in charge of the algorithm
per say, but we are able to find the difference. 

Example:

I am using this image as my example:
https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&rlz=1C1GGRV_enUS751US751&biw=1920&bih=959&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=j_VlWvPuC8vjjwTY5KfwBA&q=deer+trail+cam&oq=deer+trail+cam&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l6j0i30k1l4.7428.9857.0.10120.10.9.0.1.1.0.77.620.9.9.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.10.620...0i67k1.0._Pw3vlVM6Ls#imgrc=3jtE64iQSSJaYM:

Then I went to google VISION:
https://cloud.google.com/vision/

I tried the image into their data selection. Although buck didn't instantly
come up in my search. I did look into the JSON tab. I found this: 

`
{
      "mid": "/m/0fsjh",
      "description": "antler",
      "score": 0.8550374,
      "topicality": 0.8550374
    },
`

The key is that google vision was able to identify that it was a deer and that
it had antlers. So, please let me know your thoughts about this tool, and if 
this is the direction you all want to go. 

With Love,

Cody Myers
